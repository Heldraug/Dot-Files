# Timesheet generator

This is a timesheet generator. It will automatically generate a description with
varying timeframes so it looks credible. It removes the overhead of actually
tracking time manually which is bullshit anyway.

## Ideas

- Support a list of tasks. It generated time frames according to a given config.
- Support categories. This is a sort of config setting that varies time frames.
- Presets. Stuff that gets done frequently, like breaks and meals.
